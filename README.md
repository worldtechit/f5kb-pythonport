# F5 KB Article Index Toolkit — Python Edition

Usage guide for `f5kb`, a single-command CLI that builds and maintains a local,
full-fidelity index of F5 Knowledge Base articles (metadata + full body text) for
every document type, with no login.

Everything is one entry point with subcommands. There is no public REST API for
my.f5.com; everything runs over the Coveo guest-token search backend (a token is
fetched at runtime — no key, no login). See `FINDINGS.md` for the technical detail
behind every limit and workaround mentioned here. For a task-oriented walkthrough
(quick start + common workflows) see `HOWTO.md`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — required for dependency management and running commands
- Internet access to my.f5.com and f5networksproduction5vkhn00h.org.coveo.com
- No login or API key required — a guest token is fetched automatically and refreshed
  if it expires mid-run
- Optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` env raises the GitHub API limit (60 → 5,000 req/hr) for
  `f5kb enrich` on F5 GitHub articles

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/worldtechit/f5kb-python
cd f5kb-python
uv sync
```

Run commands with `uv run f5kb <sub>` — no venv activation needed.

## Quick start — the pipeline

The production flow is three subcommands in order: dump (metadata + indexed body) →
enrich (fill bodies the index omits) → track (master overview + change tracking). Each
reads the dump directory, so enrich and track can re-run anytime without re-hitting the
search API.

```
uv run f5kb dump --all --out=outputs/dump
uv run f5kb enrich --dump=outputs/dump
uv run f5kb track --dump=outputs/dump
uv run f5kb status
```

Generated data lives under `outputs/` (e.g. `outputs/dump/` and the SQLite
`outputs/articles.db`) and is git-ignored. Pass `--out` / `--dump` / `--db` to
override paths.

After the first build, you don't rebuild — you REFRESH incrementally with `f5kb sync`
(see below). Run `f5kb --help` for the subcommand list and global flags; `f5kb <sub>
--help` prints that subcommand's flag synopsis.

## Running tests

```
uv run pytest                     # all 301 offline tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -q      # unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/integration/  # CLI smoke tests
uv run pytest -m live             # live/network tests (require my.f5.com access)
```

No network required for the default suite — all tests use injected httpx transports
and local fixtures.

## Selecting types (`--types` / `--exclude-types`)

Every type-aware subcommand (`dump`, `enrich`, `track`, `sync`, `reconcile`, `approve`,
`recent`) accepts two complementary filters:

- `--types=A,B` — INCLUDE only these types (a subset of the configured/known types).
- `--exclude-types=A,B` — EXCLUDE these types from the working set.

They compose: include is applied first, then exclude removes from the result (so if a
type appears in both, exclude wins). With neither flag, all configured types are used.
Unknown keys are warned about and ignored.

```
# everything except the two big/low-value types (the usual production selection)
uv run f5kb sync --all --exclude-types=Community,F5_GitHub

# just two types
uv run f5kb dump --all --out=outputs/dump --types=Manual,Release_Note

# the enrichable types except F5 GitHub
uv run f5kb enrich --dump=outputs/dump --exclude-types=F5_GitHub
```

## Global flags

These apply to every subcommand (parsed before dispatch):

- `--verbose` — debug-level logging
- `--debug` — trace-level logging
- `--quiet` — warn-level logging only
- `--json-logs` — emit logs as NDJSON (one JSON object per line)
- `--help`, `-h` — show usage (bare) or the subcommand's flag synopsis
- `--version` — print the version and exit

Output discipline: human-readable progress and logs go to STDERR; machine output (any
`--json` payload) goes to STDOUT, so `f5kb track --json > out.json` captures only the JSON.

## Overwrite protection (the approval gate)

`sync`, `dump`, and `enrich` can REWRITE an article that already holds good data. If an
upstream change makes the new version worse (a reformatted page that now extracts to an
empty body, say), an unguarded rewrite would silently replace good data with bad. To
prevent that, those three commands run an approval gate BY DEFAULT:

- a NEW article (no existing file) is written straight to the live dump;
- an UNCHANGED article is left exactly as-is (not rewritten);
- an EDIT that would OVERWRITE an existing file is written to
  `<dump>/_pending/<type>/<id>.json` instead — the live file is untouched — and recorded
  in `<dump>/_pending/_manifest.json`.

You then review the staged files (diff each against its live counterpart) and run
`f5kb approve` to apply them. On approval each replaced live file is first archived to
`<dump>/_replaced/<type>/<id>.<timestamp>.json` (recoverable), then the pending version
is moved into place and the tracking DB is updated. `approve` HOLDS BACK any edit flagged
risky (its body would be dropped or errored) unless you pass `--include-risky` — so a
regression cannot be approved by accident.

Bypass: pass `--yes` to sync/dump/enrich to skip staging and overwrite in place (each
replaced file is still archived to `_replaced/` first). Use for unattended runs where
you trust the source.

Layout the gate adds under the dump dir (all gitignored with the rest of `outputs/`):

```
_pending/_manifest.json          index of staged edits (what + why)
_pending/<type>/<id>.json        the staged new version (review vs live)
_replaced/<type>/<id>.<ts>.json  archived previous version after an approval
```

See the `approve` subcommand below, and `HOWTO.md` for the day-to-day workflow.

## Subcommand — dump

Full-fidelity dumper. Writes ONE JSON file per article, grouped by document type,
splitting each article's fields into `metadata` vs `content` objects per config.yaml.
Also emits a per-type field catalogue. Protected by the approval gate (see **Overwrite
protection**): new articles are written, unchanged ones are skipped, and edits to
existing articles are staged to `_pending/` for `f5kb approve` rather than overwriting
in place. The first dump into an empty directory is all-new, so it writes everything
with nothing to approve. Pass `--yes` to overwrite in place.

Flags:

- `--days=N` — Only dump articles modified in the last N days.
- `--all` — Dump the entire corpus (no lower date bound). Provide exactly one of `--days`
  or `--all`. With `--all`, the written count is validated against the server count per
  type and shortfalls are flagged.
- `--out=DIR` — REQUIRED. Output directory (created if missing).
- `--config=FILE` — Config YAML (default: config.yaml).
- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of config type keys (default: all in config).
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these config type keys (applied after `--types`).
- `--page-size=N` — Results per API call (default: 200, max: 500). Coveo caps each
  response at 20 MB; if a page exceeds that, the page size is halved for that request
  and retried, so large content types degrade gracefully.
- `--limit=N` — Cap articles per type (default: none). For testing.
- `--db=FILE` — Tracking DB consulted to classify changed vs unchanged (default:
  `<out>/../articles.db`).
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Record each written article as added/edited to a JSONL
  changelog (default `<out>/_changelog.jsonl`). See **Changelog format**.
- `--fields-doc=F` — Deprecated no-op (catalogue annotations now come from config.yaml's
  `field_descriptions:` section).
- `--yes` — Bypass the approval gate: overwrite edited articles in place (after archiving
  the replaced file to `_replaced/`) instead of staging them to `_pending/`.

Example — dump the entire corpus:

```
uv run f5kb dump --all --out=outputs/dump
```

Example — last 7 days, one type only:

```
uv run f5kb dump --days=7 --out=outputs/dump --types=Support_Solution
```

Output layout:

```
dump/
  _index.json                  manifest (window, counts, per-type status)
  Support_Solution/
    _catalogue.json            every field seen + source/type/coverage/sample
    _catalogue.md              same, as a readable table
    K000161535.json            one file per article (named by KB id)
    ...
```

Each per-article file:

```json
{
  "id": "K000161535",
  "documentType": "Support Solution",
  "title": "K000161535: ...",
  "link": "https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000161535",
  "modifiedMs": 1780430428000,
  "modified": "2026-06-02T20:00:28.000Z",
  "capturedAt": "2026-06-02T...Z",
  "metadata": { "...selected fields...": "..." },
  "content":  { "sfdetails__c": "<full HTML body>" }
}
```

Resilience: the guest token is auto-refreshed on expiry (401/419); each type is isolated
so one type's failure does not abort the others; `_index.json` records per-type status
(ok/partial/failed) with written-vs-server counts, and the run exits non-zero if any
type failed (re-run just those with `--types=...`).

## Subcommand — enrich

Post-processes a dump directory to fill in article BODIES for the five types whose body
is absent from the Coveo search index (their `content` is left empty): Bug_Tracker,
F5_GitHub, Manual, Release_Note, Supplemental_Document. Fetches each article's public
page and extracts ONLY the body (no site chrome, nothing that just repeats metadata),
writing `content.sections` + `content.body_text` (plus `content.bodySource` and
`content.fetchedAt`) back into the per-article JSON.

Flags:

- `--dump=DIR` — Dump directory to enrich (default: outputs/dump).
- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of the enrichable types (default: all five).
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these types (applied after `--types`), e.g.
  `--exclude-types=F5_GitHub`.
- `--concurrency=N` — Parallel fetches (default: 4).
- `--delay-ms=N` — Per-worker delay between fetches in ms (default: 200).
- `--limit=N` — Cap articles per type (testing).
- `--refetch` — Re-fetch even articles that already have a body or bodyError.
- `--refetch-errors` — Re-process only articles that recorded a `content.bodyError`
  (already-bodied articles stay skipped). Use after mapping a new host or fixing a parser.
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Record body-added / body-changed / body-error events to a
  JSONL changelog (default `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`).
- `--yes` — Bypass the approval gate: a `--refetch` that would overwrite an existing
  body overwrites in place instead of staging it to `_pending/`. (Filling
  empty/errored bodies is never gated.)

Env: `GITHUB_TOKEN` raises the GitHub API rate limit from 60 to 5,000 req/hr for
F5_GitHub enrichment.

Example:

```
uv run f5kb enrich --dump=outputs/dump --types=Bug_Tracker,Manual
```

How bodies are recovered, by type:

- **Bug_Tracker**: deterministic cdn.f5.com page; two templates handled (standard
  narrative + security/CVE).
- **F5_GitHub**: GitHub REST API (issues, pulls, repo-root README, `/blob/` raw files) —
  not HTML.
- **Manual / Release_Note / Supplemental_Document**: doc-page scrape driven by a
  host→selector map (clouddocs.f5.com, techdocs.f5.com, docs.nginx.com, nginx.org,
  unit.nginx.org) with a generic fallback and a last-resort `<pre>`/`<body>` fallback
  for plain pages. docs.cloud.f5.com (Next.js) renders its body client-side, so it is
  read from the embedded `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` JSON instead of the DOM —
  no headless browser needed.

Edge cases are recorded as `content.bodyError` (never captured as a body): soft 404s
(HTTP 200 "Page Not Found"), moved-to-landing redirects, and docs.nginx.com URLs that
302 into the F5 KB (captured under the Salesforce type instead). Resumable: an article
is skipped if it already has body_text or a bodyError. Each run writes
`outputs/dump/_enrich_report.json` (per-type enriched/failed/skipped + the errored
articles). If a `<dump>/_pending/` tree exists (edits staged by a gated dump/sync),
enrich also fills the bodies of those staged articles so a reviewer sees the complete
new version before approving. A `--refetch` over an article that already has a body is
itself an overwrite, so it is gated (staged unless `--yes`).

## Subcommand — track

Maintains a master overview of every dumped article in an embedded SQLite DB (default
`outputs/articles.db`): one row per article with its dates and a hash of the metadata
and content/body. On each run it classifies articles new/changed/unchanged/removed vs
the prior run and logs every change. Run AFTER enrich so bodies are included in the
content hash.

Flags:

- `--dump=DIR` — Dump directory to index (default: outputs/dump).
- `--db=FILE` — SQLite file (default: `<dump>/../articles.db`).
- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of document types (scopes "removed" detection too).
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these types (applied after `--types`).
- `--run-id=ID` — Label for this run (default: a timestamp).
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Also record new→added / changed→edited to a JSONL changelog
  (default `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`). See **Changelog format**.
- `--json` — Emit the run summary as JSON on STDOUT.

Example:

```
uv run f5kb track --dump=outputs/dump
```

Per-article row: id, document_type, title, link; the dates created_ms /
original_published_ms / updated_published_ms / modified_ms / captured_at;
metadata_hash and content_hash (SHA-256 over canonicalized JSON, with volatile keys
bodySource/fetchedAt excluded so a re-fetch isn't a "change"); has_body; body_error;
first_seen_run / last_seen_run / last_changed_run. Changes are logged to a `changes`
table and a per-run summary to a `runs` table. Removed articles (rows in the scanned
types absent from this dump) are logged, not deleted.

## Subcommand — sync

Incremental update of a dump + its tracking DB. Instead of re-dumping and re-enriching
everything in the window, sync runs the dump/enrich/track pipeline but only TOUCHES what
actually changed:

1. Loads the prior metadata_hash of every article from the tracking DB.
2. Dumps the window, but SKIPS rewriting any article whose metadata_hash is unchanged
   (so its existing, possibly-enriched file is left intact). An article that CHANGED is
   staged to `_pending/` for review (the approval gate) rather than overwriting the live
   file; a brand-new article is written directly.
3. Enriches the new/staged files (enrich is resumable — already-bodied files are
   skipped), for the five enrichable types — including the staged ones, so a reviewer
   sees the complete new article before approving.
4. Updates the tracking DB from the LIVE dump (staged edits are excluded until approved).
5. Under `--all` only, DETECTS upstream deletions (DB ids no longer present in the live
   Coveo id set) and REPORTS them. Sync NEVER removes anything; use `reconcile --apply`
   to act on detected deletions.

After a gated sync, run `f5kb approve` to apply the staged edits (or `--yes` to skip
staging and overwrite in place). "Changed" means the metadata_hash differs. metadata
includes the published/updated dates, so a content edit that bumps
f5_updated_published_date is caught; a body-only upstream change that bumps no date is
not (re-run `enrich --refetch` to force those). A changelog is written by default (see
**Changelog format**).

Flags:

- `--all` — Full corpus. REQUIRED for deletion detection.
- `--days=N` — Only articles modified in the last N days (no deletion detection — a
  window can't prove an id is gone).
- `--since-last-run` — Window starting at the tracking DB's most recent run time
  (falls back to `--days=7` if there is no prior run).
- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of config type keys.
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these config type keys (applied after `--types`),
  e.g. `--exclude-types=Community,F5_GitHub`.
- `--out=DIR` — Dump directory (default: outputs/dump).
- `--config=FILE` — Config YAML (default: config.yaml).
- `--db=FILE` — SQLite file (default: `<out>/../articles.db`).
- `--no-enrich` — Skip the body-enrichment step.
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Changelog path (default `<out>/_changelog.jsonl`). ON by
  default for sync.
- `--no-changelog` — Disable the changelog.
- `--dry-run` — Classify + report only: write no files, DB rows, or changelog. Useful
  to preview what a sync would change.
- `--yes` — Bypass the approval gate: overwrite edited articles in place (after archiving
  each replaced file to `_replaced/`) instead of staging them to `_pending/`.
- `--page-size=N` — Results per call (default: 200, max: 500).
- `--limit=N` — Cap articles per type (testing).
- `--concurrency=N` — Enrich parallelism (default: 4).
- `--delay-ms=N` — Enrich min delay per worker in ms (default: 200).

Example — nightly incremental over everything except two low-value types:

```
uv run f5kb sync --all --exclude-types=Community,F5_GitHub
```

Example — quick catch-up since the last run, no deletion scan:

```
uv run f5kb sync --since-last-run
```

## Subcommand — reconcile

Removes articles that exist in our dump/DB but no longer exist upstream in Coveo. This
is the EXECUTION counterpart to sync's detect-and-report: reconcile is the only command
that deletes on our side, and is report-only unless you pass `--apply`. Detection is a
cheap IDs-only keyset sweep of each type's current Coveo id set, diffed against the DB.

Safety when `--apply` is given:

- a deletion-threshold guard aborts (no changes) if a type's deletions exceed
  `--max-delete-pct` of its DB rows, or total deletions exceed `--max-deletes` — so a
  bad/empty Coveo response can't wipe the index;
- the tracking DB is copied to `<db>.bak-<timestamp>` before any change;
- soft-delete by default: the article file is MOVED to `<dump>/_deleted/<type>/`
  (recoverable) and its DB row dropped;
- `--purge` hard-removes the file instead of archiving.

Flags:

- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of config type keys (default: all in config).
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these config type keys (applied after `--types`).
- `--dump=DIR` — Dump directory (default: outputs/dump).
- `--config=FILE` — Config YAML (default: config.yaml).
- `--db=FILE` — SQLite file (default: `<dump>/../articles.db`).
- `--apply` — Actually remove. Without it, reconcile only reports.
- `--purge` — Hard-remove files instead of archiving to `_deleted/`.
- `--max-delete-pct=N` — Abort if a type's deletions exceed N% of its DB rows
  (default: 10).
- `--max-deletes=N` — Abort if total deletions exceed N (optional absolute cap).
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Record deletions to a JSONL changelog (default
  `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`).
- `--page-size=N` — IDs-only sweep page size (default: 2000).
- `--json` — Emit the result as JSON on STDOUT.

Example — see what would be removed (safe, no changes):

```
uv run f5kb reconcile --all 2>&1 | tail
```

Example — apply, archiving removed articles, with a changelog:

```
uv run f5kb reconcile --apply --changelog
```

A tripped threshold guard exits non-zero (so a wrapper script notices the abort) and
makes no changes; re-run with a higher `--max-delete-pct` if the deletions are
genuinely real.

## Subcommand — approve

The human checkpoint for the approval gate (see **Overwrite protection**). A gated
sync/dump/enrich stages would-overwrite edits under `<dump>/_pending/`; `approve`
applies them to the live dump. For each promoted edit the replaced live file is archived
to `<dump>/_replaced/<type>/<id>.<timestamp>.json`, the pending version is moved into
place, and the tracking DB is reindexed to match.

Safety default: an edit flagged risky (body-dropped or body-error — the new version
would lose or fail to capture a body the live file has) is HELD BACK and reported; pass
`--include-risky` to apply those too. Both the risk flags AND the changed parts
(metadata / content) are recomputed fresh from the actual files at approve time, so they
reflect reality after any enrich pass. Each promoted edit is logged to the changelog
with `changed` = the parts that differ (`["metadata"]`, `["content"]`, or both) and a
`detail` label like `metadata-only` / `metadata+content`; `--list` shows the same in
parentheses, e.g. `Manual/K123  (metadata+content)`.

The changelog is ON by default for approve (this is the moment edits actually become
live, so it belongs in the history) — it writes to `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`. Use
`--no-changelog` to disable or `--changelog=FILE` to redirect.

Flags:

- `--dump=DIR` — Dump directory (default: outputs/dump).
- `--db=FILE` — SQLite file (default: `<dump>/../articles.db`).
- `--types="A,B"` — Only act on these type dirs.
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these type dirs (applied after `--types`).
- `--ids="K1,K2"` — Only act on these article ids.
- `--list` — Preview: show each pending edit + its change kind + risk flags, change
  nothing.
- `--reject` — Discard the staged files instead of promoting them (the live data is
  left as-is).
- `--include-risky` — Also promote edits flagged risky (default: hold them back).
- `--no-archive` — Don't keep a `_replaced/` copy of overwritten files.
- `--changelog[=FILE]` — Changelog path (default `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`). ON by
  default for approve. Records op="edited", source="approve". See **Changelog format**.
- `--no-changelog` — Disable the changelog.
- `--json` — Print the result as JSON on STDOUT.

Example — review what is staged, then apply the safe ones:

```
uv run f5kb approve --list
uv run f5kb approve
```

Example — a body-dropped edit you have verified is correct anyway:

```
uv run f5kb approve --include-risky --ids=K12345
```

Example — throw away the staged changes (keep the live versions):

```
uv run f5kb approve --reject
```

To recover a wrongly-approved article, copy it back from `<dump>/_replaced/`.

## Changelog format

Mutating subcommands (sync, dump, enrich, track, reconcile, approve) can append a
structured changelog via `--changelog[=FILE]`. It is JSONL: one JSON object per line,
append-only, so it is a greppable, streamable history across runs (default file:
`<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`). sync writes it by default; the others opt in.

Each line has these keys (required first, then optional):

| Key            | Type   | Meaning                                                              |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runId`        | string | the run this record belongs to (ISO timestamp; shared with the runs/changes tables) |
| `ts`           | string | ISO timestamp when the record was written                            |
| `op`           | string | `added` \| `edited` \| `deleted` \| `body-added` \| `body-changed` \| `body-error` |
| `documentType` | string | the article's document type (e.g. "Bug Tracker")                     |
| `id`           | string | the article id (matches the per-article filename)                    |
| `title`        | string | (optional) article title                                             |
| `changed`      | array  | (optional) which parts changed, for `op="edited"`: `["metadata"]`, `["content"]`, or both (approve computes this from the live vs new files) |
| `hashOld`      | string | (optional) prior metadata_hash (absent ⇒ newly added)               |
| `hashNew`      | string | (optional) new metadata_hash                                         |
| `source`       | string | (optional) dump \| enrich \| track \| reconcile \| sync \| approve  |
| `detail`       | string | (optional) free text (bodyError message, archive path, "detected upstream…") |

op meanings: `added` comes from the dump/track classification (a new article applied
immediately); `edited` is logged when an edit is APPLIED — either an in-place overwrite
(source=dump under `--yes`) or, under the gate, when `approve` promotes a staged edit
(source=approve). A staged-but-not-yet-approved edit is NOT logged as edited; it lives
in `_pending/_manifest.json` until approved. `body-added` (an empty body filled),
`body-changed` (an existing body replaced), and `body-error` (a bodyError recorded
instead of a body) come from enrich; `deleted` comes from `reconcile --apply` (actually
removed) or from sync (detected upstream, reported only — its detail says so and nothing
is removed).

A minimal line carries only the five required keys; optionals appear only when set.
Example lines:

```json
{"runId":"2026-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","ts":"2026-06-04T00:00:01.2Z","op":"added","documentType":"Policy","id":"K12345","source":"dump"}
{"runId":"2026-06-04T16:13:32.685Z","ts":"2026-06-04T16:13:40.1Z","op":"edited","documentType":"Manual","id":"K321","changed":["metadata","content"],"source":"approve","detail":"metadata+content; replaced file archived"}
{"runId":"2026-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","ts":"2026-06-04T00:00:09.8Z","op":"deleted","documentType":"Manual","id":"K98","source":"reconcile","detail":"archived to _deleted/Manual/"}
```

## Subcommand — status

Read-only health report for a dump and its tracking DB. Aggregates several sources, each
handled gracefully when absent: `<dump>/_index.json` (per-type expected/written/status),
`<dump>/_enrich_report.json` (per-type enriched/failed/skipped), on-disk per-type file
counts, and the tracking DB (articles/runs tables). If a `<dump>/_changelog.jsonl`
exists it is surfaced too, with the most recent run's per-op tally
(added/edited/deleted/body-*), and any edits staged in `<dump>/_pending/` awaiting
`f5kb approve` are flagged. Never writes.

Flags:

- `--dump=DIR` — Dump directory (default: outputs/dump).
- `--db=FILE` — SQLite file (default: `<dump>/../articles.db`).
- `--json` — Emit the report as JSON on STDOUT instead of a table.

Example:

```
uv run f5kb status
```

## Subcommand — fetch

Lighter-weight exploratory fetch (predates the pipeline). Fetches articles by product
and/or type into a flat JSON array, optionally also a CSV. Each article is the five
stable fields: name, link, summary, publicationDate, modificationDate.

Flags:

- `--product=NAME` — Filter by product (e.g. "BIG-IP", "NGINX Plus", "F5OS").
- `--type=NAME` — Filter by document type (e.g. "Support Solution").
- `--limit=N` — Stop after N articles (default: all).
- `--output=FILE` — JSON output (default: auto-named, e.g. f5_NGINX_Plus_...json).
- `--csv=FILE` — Also write a CSV file (optional).
- `--page-size=N` — Results per call (default: 100, max: 1000).

Example — NGINX Plus Security Advisories, JSON + CSV:

```
uv run f5kb fetch \
    --product="NGINX Plus" --type="Security Advisory" \
    --csv=nginx_security.csv
```

(`fetch` takes a single `--product` / `--type` value as a Coveo query filter — distinct
from the `--types`/`--exclude-types` type-key selection the pipeline commands use.) For
valid product values, see config.yaml's `products:` section (or run `f5kb list-products`
for the global facet; `f5kb discover` for the full set). The 5,000-offset cap is handled
automatically via date-range chunking; results are deduped.

## Subcommand — recent

Fetches articles modified within the last N days and writes one JSON file per document
type into a chosen directory, plus an `_index.json` manifest. Exploratory; prefer
`dump --days=N` for the full-fidelity pipeline.

Flags:

- `--days=N` — REQUIRED. Window size: articles modified in the last N days.
- `--out=DIR` — REQUIRED. Output directory (created if missing).
- `--types="A,B"` — Subset of document types (default: all).
- `--exclude-types="A,B"` — Exclude these document types (applied after `--types`).
- `--page-size=N` — Results per call (default: 500, max: 1000).
- `--limit=N` — Cap articles per type (testing).

Example:

```
uv run f5kb recent --days=7 --out=last_week
```

Each per-type file: `{documentType, days, cutoff, generatedAt, count, articles[]}` where
each article is `{name, link, summary, publicationDate, modificationDate}`. The window is
enforced server-side on Coveo's @date (a re-index superset) and then refined client-side on the per-record
modification timestamp, so the output strictly honours N days. The 5,000-offset cap is
handled via date-range chunking.

## Subcommand — list-types

Prints all document types with their article counts (from the global facet). No flags.

```
uv run f5kb list-types
uv run f5kb list-types --json
```

## Subcommand — list-products

Prints the products known to the global Coveo facet (~73, fast) with counts. No flags.
The global facet is incomplete — many valid products are hidden from it; use
`f5kb discover` for the full set.

```
uv run f5kb list-products
uv run f5kb list-products --json
```

## Subcommand — discover

Deep product discovery. The Coveo global facet returns only ~73 top-level products; ~247
more valid product names are hidden from it by F5's admin config but remain queryable
with `--product=`. This subcommand surfaces them by running a type-filtered facet query
per document type, then a count query for each hidden product. Takes ~3–4 minutes (~250
API calls).

Flags:

- `--out=FILE` — Output file (default: discovered_products.yaml).
- `--format=yaml|json` — Output format (default: yaml).

```
uv run f5kb discover
uv run f5kb discover --format=json --out=products.json
```

It writes a side-file (NOT config.yaml). The file uses the same `products:` schema as
config.yaml (generatedAt + entries:). To refresh the curated snapshot, copy the
`products:` block from discovered_products.yaml into config.yaml by hand — discover
never edits config.yaml. See the config section below and FINDINGS.md "Product
discovery" for why the global facet is incomplete, the BIG-IP Documentation TechComm
source, and the confirmed duplicate product tag pairs.

Each entry:

```json
{"product": "BIG-IP TMOS", "count": 3570, "source": "type_filtered_facet",
 "hiddenFromGlobalFacet": true, "discoveredViaTypes": ["Bug Tracker"]}

{"product": "BIG-IP", "count": 48453, "source": "global_facet",
 "hiddenFromGlobalFacet": false}
```

Fields: `product` (use as `--product` value), `count` (total across all doc types),
`source` (how it was found), `hiddenFromGlobalFacet`, `discoveredViaTypes` (for hidden
products: which document types revealed it).

## config.yaml

`config.yaml` is the single source of truth, with three sections:

- **`types:`** — one entry per document type, read by `f5kb dump`. Each entry:
  - `documentType` — Exact Coveo f5_document_type value (what the API filters on).
  - `metadata` — Fields routed to the entry's `metadata` object.
  - `content` — Fields routed to the entry's `content` object.

  `metadata` / `content` each accept either `"*"` (include every field returned by the
  API) or a `[a, b, c]` keep-list (matched by bare name against both the top-level
  result object and the raw field bag; top-level wins on a name clash; content wins over
  metadata on overlap). The shipped config covers all 15 types with a curated metadata
  keep-list and the correct body field per backend (Salesforce → sfdetails__c, Community
  → limessagebody, Education → zendeskdescription; Manual / Release Note / Supplemental
  Document / F5 GitHub / Bug Tracker → `content: []` because the index returns no body
  — those are filled by `f5kb enrich`).

- **`field_descriptions:`** — field-name → short description, used only to annotate the
  dump catalogue. This is the machine copy of FINDINGS.md Appendix A.

- **`products:`** — a READ-ONLY snapshot of discovered products. The pipeline does NOT
  read this section; it is a reference for valid `--product` values. Refresh it via
  `f5kb discover` (writes discovered_products.yaml; copy its `products:` block in).

Workflow to curate a new type: set `metadata: "*"`, run `f5kb dump` once, open that
type's `_catalogue.md` to see every field with coverage/description/sample, then replace
`"*"` with an explicit keep-list of the fields you want.

## Coveo API limits (handled automatically)

The Coveo backend enforces two hard limits; the toolkit works around both. See
FINDINGS.md for the full technical explanation.

1. `firstResult + numberOfResults` cannot exceed 5,000. When a result set is larger,
   `dump --all` uses keyset pagination by @rowid (no offset cap, and it captures docs a
   date window would miss); `dump --days`, `fetch`, and `recent` use recursive
   date-range chunking.
2. A single response cannot exceed 20 MB. The dump halves the page size for any request
   that exceeds it and retries; the flat fetchers request only the fields they use,
   keeping responses small.

Other notes:

- The guest token is valid ~24h and is auto-refreshed mid-run on 401/419.
- Results are sorted newest first (by Coveo index @date) except `dump --all`, which
  sorts by @rowid for keyset paging.
- The live corpus drifts between runs; counts changing is expected. `dump` validates
  written-vs-server and `track` records the delta.
- Field availability varies by document type (three source backends: Salesforce
  Knowledge, non-SF connectors, Zendesk). See FINDINGS.md Appendix A.
