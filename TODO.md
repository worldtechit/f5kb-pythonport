# F5 KB Toolkit — TODO

Open work and a log of what's been shipped. See OUTLINE.md for how the code works
and FINDINGS.md for what we learned about the scraped system.


## OPEN: SITEMAP GAP (47 COVEO-UNINDEXED K-ARTICLES)

The my.f5.com sitemap lists 47 K-article IDs that are absent from the Coveo index
(so the pipeline can't reach them) — see FINDINGS.md "Sitemap" section for the
method and analysis. ~2 are recent (likely indexing lag → re-check on a future dump;
if they appear in Coveo, no action). The other ~45 are old (2023–early 2026) and only
reachable by scraping the my.f5.com Salesforce SPA per-article.

TODO:
- Periodically re-derive the gap (re-run the sitemap diff) and confirm the recent
  ones get picked up by Coveo over time.
- DECIDE whether the ~45 old ones are worth a per-article my.f5.com SPA scrape
  (likely superseded/unpublished; low value). If yes, build a small targeted scraper
  (parse the article page's embedded data, not headless) for just these.
- Also re-check whether the sitemap's Security-Advisory under-listing matters for
  any external cross-checks (our dump has 252 SAs the sitemap omits).

The 47 IDs (id and sitemap lastmod date):

## OPEN: PRODUCTS DRIFT

The last sync flagged one live product not in `config.yaml`: **"BIG-IP Next CNF"**.
Run `uv run f5kb discover` and copy the refreshed `products:` block into `config.yaml`
if you want it captured (the pipeline does NOT read `products:`, so this is
reference-only).


## OPEN: POSSIBLE FUTURE GUARDS

- A `--max-staged` abort for a sync that would stage an enormous `_pending/` (mirrors
  reconcile's threshold guard).
- A combined "sync then reconcile --apply" wrapper, if the report-then-execute
  two-step ever proves tedious in practice.
- Body-only upstream changes that bump no date are not detected by `metadata_hash`
  (rare). `enrich --refetch` remains the escape hatch; could be automated by adding
  a periodic forced re-enrich.

## DONE 2026-06-17: PYTHON PORT MIGRATION

Migrated from Deno/TypeScript to Python 3.11+ / uv. Full history:

- Code moved from `python/` subdirectory to repo root via `git mv`.
- All Deno/TypeScript artifacts removed (`f5kb.ts`, `deno.json`, `deno.lock`,
  `cmd/` (TS), `lib/` (TS), `test/` (TS)).
- Package manager changed to uv (hatchling build system); `uv sync` replaces
  `deno cache`. All pip/venv references removed.
- Documentation rewritten: CLAUDE.md, README.md, MEMORIES.md, OUTLINE.md,
  HOWTO.md (was HOWTO.txt), FINDINGS.md (was FINDINGS.txt), TODO.md (was TODO.txt).
- Code modernization: `__import__()` anti-patterns fixed; `import re` moved to
  module top; `has_body()` kept in two places (different semantics — not
  consolidated); `iso_now()` consolidated into `lib/fsutil.py`; `-> None` type hints
  added to all 12 cmd functions; `HttpClient.get()` public method added so
  `github.py` no longer accesses `._client` directly.
- Test coverage: new unit tests for `dump_types()`, `sync_dump()`, `reconcile()`,
  `Progress` class; live integration tests in `tests/integration/test_live.py`.
- All 301 offline tests pass. Remote: `worldtechit/f5kb-pythonport`, branch `main`.


## DONE 2026-06-04: INCREMENTAL SYNC + DELETION RECONCILE + CHANGELOG

`f5kb sync` loads each article's prior `metadata_hash` from the DB and SKIPS
rewriting unchanged articles; enrich's existing resumability then auto-limits body
fetches to the rewritten (changed) files. Modes: `--all`, `--days=N`,
`--since-last-run`. Detection of upstream deletions runs under `--all` only (needs
the full live id set) and is REPORTED, never executed.

`f5kb reconcile` is the explicit, guarded executor for deletions (report-only unless
`--apply`; threshold guard + DB backup; soft-delete to `_deleted/` or `--purge`).
It is the only command that removes data.

`--changelog[=FILE]` on every mutating op appends JSONL change records; sync writes
one by default.


## DONE 2026-06-04: OVERWRITE PROTECTION (APPROVAL GATE) + approve COMMAND

sync/dump/enrich no longer silently overwrite a live article that already holds good
data. An EDIT is STAGED to `<dump>/_pending/<type>/<id>.json` (live untouched) and
recorded in `_pending/_manifest.json`; new articles are written directly, unchanged
are skipped.

`f5kb approve` promotes staged edits: archive the replaced live file to `_replaced/`,
move pending → live, reindex the DB. Edits flagged risky (`body-dropped` / `body-error`,
recomputed fresh from the files) are HELD unless `--include-risky`; `--list` previews,
`--reject` discards.

`--yes` on sync/dump/enrich bypasses the gate (overwrite in place, still archiving
to `_replaced/`). `list_type_dirs` skips `_`-prefixed dirs so `_pending/_replaced/
_deleted` are never indexed as article types.


## DONE 2026-06-04: FULL-CORPUS DUMP (13 types, all except Community + F5 GitHub)

106,042 articles. `f5kb dump --all` → `f5kb enrich` → `f5kb track`. All 13 types'
on-disk counts == live Coveo counts (verified). Body coverage:
Bug_Tracker/Release_Note/Supplemental 100%, Manual 99% (the ~239 no-body cases are
all legitimate: soft-404 dead links, moved-to-landing redirects, image-only/empty
stub pages, 1 KB cross-reference). Tracking DB: `outputs/articles.db`.


## DONE: BODY ENRICHMENT FOR 5 EMPTY-INDEX TYPES

Bug Tracker, F5 GitHub, Manual, Release Note, Supplemental Document — see
FINDINGS.md "Body recovery" and README.md. No headless browser needed (docs.cloud.f5.com
bodies come from the page's embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON).


## DONE: PIPELINE HARDENING

Dump path gained `--all` (full corpus), guest-token refresh on 401/419, per-type
error isolation, written-vs-server count validation, and a richer `_index.json` +
non-zero exit on failures. Enrich path gained `--refetch-errors` and writes
`_enrich_report.json`. SQLite master overview added (`f5kb track`).
